# ChatX
![ChatGPT](Images/logo.png)

My experimental GhatGPT-like project based on PrivateAI api.

Warning: PrivateAI is privatedata-oriented version of ChatGPT... but it's also ChatGPT ;)

Free plan has some limits like 4 messegas per second & 75 messages per day. It's good for my little RnD.

## About 
A simple multi-platform implementation of a Xamarin.Forms AI app mixed with PrivateAI-based api. ;)
